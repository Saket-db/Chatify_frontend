# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Troubleshooting

### 'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command

If you see this error, make sure you have installed all dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install Vite and other required packages. After installation, you can run:

```sh
npm run dev
```
